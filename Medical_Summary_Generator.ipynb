Have you had any previous medical issues?\\nPatient: No, I haven't.\\nDoctor: Alright, we'll need to run some tests to determine the cause of your chest pain. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.\\nPatient: What's that?\\nDoctor: It's a type of heart attack that doesn't show up on an electrocardiogram. We'll need to do some imaging to confirm the diagnosis.\\nPatient: Okay, what's the next step?\\nDoctor: You'll need to be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated findings of empty sella syndrome with no distortion of optic nerves or posterior aspect of the optic globe.\\nPatient: What does that mean?\\nDoctor: Empty sella syndrome is a condition where the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, and the sella turcica (the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland) appears empty. We will need to do a fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture to measure your CSF pressure to exclude intracranial hypertension.\\nPatient: Okay, what are the results?\\nDoctor: The opening CSF pressure was 7 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 15 cm of H20 by fluid column method. A total of 16 cc of clear CSF was removed. The final pressure was 3 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 5 cm of H2O by fluid column method.\\nPatient: That sounds complicated.\\nDoctor: Your headache worsened after the procedure, which is a possible side effect.

After the procedure, you became hypotensive. Did you experience any other symptoms?\\nPatient: No, just feeling a bit dizzy.\\nDoctor: Okay. In order to exclude pericardial effusion, a transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and a mass was detected in the left atrium with LA dilatation and estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure over tricuspid regurgitant jet was 43 mmHg. You were then sent to our clinic for surgery with a possible diagnosis of LA myxoma. Do you understand?\\nPatient: Yes, I do.\\nDoctor: Your left ventricular ejection fraction was 60%. We decided to perform surgical excision of the mass. Following median sternotomy, we reached the LA via a transseptal approach. We saw a giant mass in the LA, nearby the mitral valve. The mitral valve was intact without any deformation. We excised the mass, which invaded the myocardium towards the posterior wall of the LA. The LA was hypertrophic in nature, so all the mass with LA was resected. The mass consisted of central necrotic parts which did not resemble atrial myxoma. Intraoperative frozen pathology specimen was reported as benign tissue, rich in fibrosis, but not myxoma. Do you have any questions?\\nPatient: What does all this mean for my condition, doctor?\\nDoctor: Well, we repaired the defective posterior atrial wall by using autologous pericardium, fixed by 0.625% glutaraldehyde solution. After closing the septum and the right atriotomy, RCA bypass over PD segment was performed using a saphenous vein graft, and the aortic occlusion time was 141 minutes. Since you had first-degree heart blockage, a temporary pacemaker lead was inserted. You will need to follow up with me regularly to ensure proper healing and monitor your condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chest computed tomography (CT) was obtained and reaffirmed the findings (Figures -). Pneumomediastinum in the setting of intractable vomiting was worrisome for esophageal rupture and since our facility was not staffed to manage this clinical entity, the patient was emergently transferred to another facility.

Over the past 2 years, the patient noted complete hair loss in the legs, thinning and increased vulnerability of the skin of the lower limbs, and the appearance of limited areas of severe hyperkeratosis on the feet.

Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, muscle strength in the flexors of the lower legs was reduced by 4 grades, by 5 grades in the extensors, and 5 grades in the distal sections.\\nPatient: What does all of that mean?\\nDoctor: It means that you are experiencing significant nerve damage and muscle weakness due to your condition. We will need to start you on treatment to manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. \\nPatient: Okay, what kind of treatment?\\nDoctor: We will start with medication to control your symptoms, as well as physical therapy to improve your muscle strength and mobility. We will also need to monitor your body mass index to address the class II alimentary-constitutional obesity that you are suffering from. \\nPatient: Alright, I understand. \\nDoctor: Before we start treatment, we will also need to conduct hand dynamometry to measure your muscle strength. Do you have any questions or concerns?\\nPatient: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you, doctor.\\nDoctor: Of course. Please follow up with us regularly to monitor your progress. If you experience any new symptoms or complications, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will also keep your family informed of your progress.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: I'm not feeling well, doctor. I have been experiencing swelling and pain at the left side of my neck for a month now.\\nDoctor: I see. You were referred to us from Sa Kaeo, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\\nDoctor: And I see from your clinical note that you were admitted to a local hospital for low-grade fever, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness. You were given ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a presumptive diagnosis of deep neck infection. Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: I also see that you have a history of hypertension and are currently being treated with amlodipine and enalapril. You've been drinking heavily and smoking for the past 40 years, is that right?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Upon admission, we found that you had a body weight of 52 kg and a body mass index of 19.7\\u202fkg/m2. Your vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.7\\u202f\\u00b0C; blood pressure, 170/100\\u202fmmHg; pulse rate, 100 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min. We also noted mild pale conjunctivae and anicteric sclerae. \\nPatient: Hmm, I see.\\nDoctor: During the physical examination, we found a pulsatile left neck mass measuring 5\\u202f\\u00d7\\u202f5\\u202fcm in diameter. It was mild tender on palpation, but there was no sign of inflammation. There was no limitation of neck movement. We also found bulging of the left posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsil enlargement causing narrowing of the upper airway. Thyroid gland was not enlarged.\\nPatient: Okay.\\nDoctor: We also conducted other exams including neurological exam which were normal. We also found multiple ill-defined scaly mild erythematous patches on both legs and dystrophic nails. Initial laboratory results showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 9.6\\u202fg/L and Hematocrit of 28%, MCV of 75 fl, white blood cell count of 6800 cells/mm3 with 80% neutrophil 7.7% lymphocytes, platelet count of 574,000 cells/mm3. Hemoglobin typing was normal (HbAA).\\nPatient: What does this all mean, doctor?\\nDoctor: Based on these results, we have diagnosed you with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We will need to conduct more tests to determine the extent of the malignancy and the appropriate treatment plan.\\nPatient's Family: (if applicable) What are our options now, doctor?\\nDoctor: We will need to conduct further tests, such as a biopsy and imaging scans, to determine the stage of the cancer. We will also need to discuss treatment options, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. We will keep you updated on your loved one's condition and provide support throughout the treatment process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
