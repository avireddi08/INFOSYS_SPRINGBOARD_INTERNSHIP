Project : AI-Driven Patient Follow-Up and Health Outcome Prediction System for Telemedicine
This repository contains multiple AI-driven projects designed to aid in the medical field. The goal of these projects is to assist healthcare professionals by automating tasks related to patient follow-ups, health outcome predictions, medical conversations, and summaries. Below is a brief description of each project in this repository.

1. Lung Cancer Level Prediction
This project predicts the severity or stage of lung cancer based on patient data using machine learning models. The model analyzes various medical attributes and clinical data to determine the likelihood of cancer progression.

2. Medical Conversation Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing medical conversations between doctors and patients. It processes and analyzes text data from medical transcripts to extract valuable insights, such as predicting patient conditions and detecting sentiment. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing, age and gender extraction, and sentiment analysis.

3. Medical Conversation Dashboard
This project implements a dashboard that provides interactive visualizations and insights from medical conversation data. The dashboard includes various metrics such as sentiment distribution, condition severity, and conversation analysis. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a quick overview of patient interactions.

4. Medical Summary Generator
This project generates concise medical summaries from patient conversations or records. It processes medical texts, extracts key information, and produces summaries that can be used by healthcare providers for quick patient reference or decision-making.

5. Patient Follow-Up Scheduler
This project automates patient follow-up scheduling using Cal.com's API. It schedules appointments based on patient severity levels (e.g., high-risk patients) and sends reminders to doctors or support staff. The system helps ensure timely follow-up care for patients, improving healthcare management and patient outcomes.
